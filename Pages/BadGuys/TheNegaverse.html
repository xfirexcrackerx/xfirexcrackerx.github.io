    <p>The Negaverse is an evil universe ruled by Queen Beryl and the Negaforce. The
        inhabitants of the Negaverse are the main villains of Sailor Moon.<br><br>
        Inside the Negaverse, Queen Beryl sends her commanders Jedite, Neflite, Zoycite, and
        Malachite to gather energy for the Negaforce, find the seven Rainbow Crystals, or else
        destroy Sailor Moon.<br><br>
        The monsters of the Negaverse are Negamonsters, and are often sent by the commanders to
        get the job done.<br><br>
        At one point, although this was not revealed until Sailor Moon R, the Negaverse corrupted
        Alan and Ann's alien race. Alan and Ann were in contact with Queen Beryl who told them
        about Earth at one point.<br><br>
        The Negaverse was destroyed along with Queen Beryl and the Negaforce when Princess Serena
        used Cosmic Moon Power.<br><br>
        The Negamoon is believed to be a moon of the Negaverse.

    <h4>Fate</h4>
    <p>All the Negamonsters were destroyed.<br>
    Jedite was put into Eternal Sleep by Queen Beryl - an eternal sleep that involved him being
        frozen in an impenetrable block of ice. This was punishment for his failure.<br>
    Neflite turned good, but was killed by one of Zoycite's monsters, Housenka, when she stabbed
        him with thorns.<br>
    Zoycite was killed by Queen Beryl as a punishment for disobeying her.<br>
    Malachite was killed when Sailor Moon reflected his own energy blade back at him.<br>
    Prince Darien was healed by Sailor Moon.<br>
    Queen Beryl and the Negaforce merged into one, and was destroyed by Sailor Moon using Cosmic
        Moon Power.<br>
    After the destruction of the Negaverse, Alan and Ann came to Earth and eventually turned
        good<br>
