        invaded Earth, tried to attack Crystal Tokyo of the future, and take over Tokyo in the
        past. Its name implies that it may have been associated with the Negaverse.

        destroyed by Sailor Moon's Moon Scepter Elimination.<br>
        Sapphire discovered that Wiseman was using them, and turned good and attempted to warn
        Diamond, but was killed by Wiseman.<br>
        Diamond also turned good, and sacrifiiced himself to save Sailor Moon from an attack by
        Wiseman, being impaled by it.<br>
