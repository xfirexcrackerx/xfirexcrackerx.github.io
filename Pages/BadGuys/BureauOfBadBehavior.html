    <p>The <abbr title="Bureau of Bad Behavior">BBR</abbr> is an evil organization
        led by <a

        appeared in <a href="../seasons%20and%20episodes/3SailorMoonS.html"> Sailor Moon S</a>.<br><br>
        Their goal is to awaken their master,<a
                href="http://sailormoondub.wikia.com/wiki/Pharaoh_90"> Pharaoh 90</a>. At first,
        they were looking for Pure
        Hearts in search of three particular Pure Heart Crystals to make the <a

        appear, but it ended up in the possession of Sailor Moon.<br><br>
        They then began looking for Pure Hearts to feed to <a href="http://sailormoondub.wikia.com/wiki/Mistress_9"> Mistress 9</a>. Nearly
        every major member was killed in the process, except Doctor Tomoe, who had been
        possessed by <a href="http://sailormoondub.wikia.com/wiki/Germatoid">Germatoid</a>. In
