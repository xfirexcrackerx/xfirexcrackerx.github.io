        <figcaption>The Dark Moon Circus is the circus of the Dark Moon, run by Zirconia and Queen Nehelenia.
            Nehelenia's subjects all became Remless when she became obsessed with eternal youth
            and beauty. When she was imprisoned in a mirror, she sent Zirconia, created from her
            fear of becoming ugly. The Dark Moon Circus invaded Elysion, Helios's dream world, to
            get the golden crystal, but Helios became Pegasus and entered Rini's dreams after he
            was imprisoned in Nehelenia's mirror.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The Dark Moon Circus then arrived on Earth at a solar eclipse to find out
            whose dreams Pegasus was hiding in, so they could capture him and take the golden
            crystal. First the Amazon Trio looked for Pegasus, but couldn't find him. They
            eventually turned good, were given dream mirrors by Pegasus, and taken to Elysion.
            The Amazon Quartet took over from here. Eventually they turned good as well,
            destroying the orbs Nehelenia gave them so Zirconia couldn't take power from them
            anymore.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>All the Remless were destroyed, and Zirconia was destroyed as well when
            Nehelenia escaped her mirror. She fought the Sailor Scouts, and was defeated by
            Sailor Moon and Sailor Mini Moon, destroying all the circus tents except the main
            one, which eventually disintegrated after Nehelenia returned to her mirror.</figcaption>
