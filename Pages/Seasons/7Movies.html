            <p>Fiore, an old childhood friend of Mamoru's, returns to Earth with the flowers he
                promised him when he was younger. But, an evil flower called the Xenian Flower
                takes over his weak mind, and controls him. Now, it's up to Sailor Moon and the
                Inner Senshi to save Mamoru and the Earth from destruction.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Plot</summary>
            <p>In his youth as a six-year-old, Mamoru is involved in a terrible car accident that
                claims the lives of his parents and leaves him with amnesia. One day, a strange
                boy called Fiore comes to Earth and befriends the young orphan, despite Fiore
                having to leave soon. Mamoru rushes to his friend to give him a single rose,
                which Fiore accepts before his departure, prompting Mamoru to tears. Fiore
                assures him that someday he will return and bring him many flowers.</p>
            <p>Many years pass and Mamoru has grown into a young man, with Usagi as his
                girlfriend. One day, Chibiusa, Usagi and the Inner Senshi are visiting a garden,
                and Mamoru recalls his friend's last words before being interrupted by Usagi as
                she talks about a forget-me-not flower. A strong wind blows, and Fiore appears,
                now a young man, whom Mamoru does not recognize initially. Usagi informs Fiore
                that Mamoru is her boyfriend, but Fiore shoves her to the ground and disappears
                while the other girls run to her side.</p>
            <p>Later that night, the girls discuss a far-away meteorite on its way to Earth.
                Usagi is asked if she knows what happened earlier, but she answers that she
                hardly know Mamoru's past, recollecting one day when he explained that he was
                alone by showing her a picture of his parents. He says that he is no longer alone
                since he met Usagi and she became his new family, which makes Usagi happy and she
                responds that she will do anything to protect him.</p>
            <p>The Silver Crystal changed form, destroying the Xenian flower and causing Fiore to
                disappear. Sailor Moon transforms into Princess Serenity to save Earth and the
                Senshi. Mamoru transforms as well, and he and the Senshi pool their powers to
                save the world. However, the Silver Crystal shatters, and Sailor Moon dies.
                Sailor Mars tries in vain to revive her and Mamoru holds her body when Fiore
                appears for the last time. He thanks him and Sailor Moon for releasing him from
                possession and gives Mamoru a nectar flower, and with it, Fiore's energy. Mamoru
                wets his lips and kisses Sailor Moon, who comes back to life and Fiore vanishes.</p>

            <summary>Trivia</summary>
            <ol>
                <li>Due to Chibiusa's inclusion in the main cast and her knowledge of the Sailor
                    Senshi's identities, and also Mamoru and Usagi's intact relationship, this
                    story most likely took place after episode 77 and before episode 82 since
                    Chibiusa was still in the present.</li>
                <li>When this movie was screened in theaters in France (as Sailor Moon: Les
                    Fleurs Maléfiques ("Sailor Moon: The Evil Flowers"), the short Make up!
                    Sailor Senshi was replaced by another short based on the anime Tsuyoshi
                    Shikkari Shinasai.</li>
                <li>In Pioneer's R1 DVD release of the movie, the voice of young Mamoru was
                    incorrectly credited as "Emi Ogata."</li>
                <li>The display in the Mercury Goggle was in German in the movie, as opposed to
                    English in the television series.</li>
                <li>The English dub was produced by Pioneer Entertainment and Optimum
                    Productions, instead of DiC.</li>
                <li>In the English dub, the song "Moon Revenge" was replaced with "The Power of
                    Love." The original song was restored for the unedited DVD release.</li>
                <li>Moon Princess Halation was once again renamed; unlike the first two season
                    dubbed by DiC, instead of using Moon Sceptre Elimination or Moon Sceptre
                    Activation, it was dubbed as Moon Princess Elimination.</li>

            <summary>Trivia</summary>
            <ol>
                <li>This movie was based on The Lover of Princess Kaguya and was the only one of
                    the three original Sailor Moon movies based on the manga.</li>
                <li>This movie featured a tailor-made astronaut's helmet for Usagi, which had two
                    small spheres protruding from the helmet to accommodate her odango as
                    revealed from her imagination.</li>
                <li>In some of the shots during the fight with Princess Snow Kaguya, Sailor
                    Pluto's sailor fuku mistakenly had shoulder pads attached to it.</li>
                <li>In this movie Luna's human form was seen for the first and only time in the
                    original anime, though she is briefly seen again in this form in Act 14 of
                    Sailor Moon Crystal. Silver Crystal Power was also used for the first and only time in this movie.</li>
                <li>Due to the presence of three out of three Outer Senshi, Chibiusa, and the
                    Holy Grail, as well as the winter break being mentioned, this movie likely
                    took place sometime around Episode 122 before Hotaru Tomoe was revealed to be
                    the reincarnation of Sailor Saturn.</li>
                <li>In the English dub, the song Moonlight Destiny was replaced with Nothing At All.</li>
                <li>Luna's transformation into her human form was partially cut from the English
                    dub due to the nudity present in the scene.</li>
                <li>In the manga version, Princess Snow Kaguya was destroyed by Rainbow Moon
                    Heart Ache while in the original anime version, she was destroyed by a
                    convergence attack performed by all nine Sailor Senshi called Silver Crystal Power.</li>
                <li>Chibiusa is given a full transformation sequence unlike her short ones in Sailor Moon S.</li>
                <li>Crisis, Make Up was dubbed in English as Super Moon Crisis Power instead of
                    Moon Crisis Power like the English dub of Sailor Moon S.</li>
                <li>The word Reform was added at the end of Rainbow Moon Heart Ache in the English dub.</li>

            <summary>Summary</summary>
            <p>Sailor Moon SuperS: The Movie was the third and final movie of the original anime
                series. The movie was dubbed into English by Pioneer Entertainment and Optimum
                Productions,[1] who released it in two versions. The first version aired on
                television and was released on VHS, and included DiC's music and censorship to
                the Sailor Senshi transformations. The second version was released on DVD and was
                uncut with most of the original music, though it still used the opening song from
                the dub with the English-language track. The English dub also released it with
                the subtitle "Black Dream Hole".</p>

            <summary>Plot</summary>
            <p>The third movie follows Queen Badiane's diabolical plot to kidnap the children of
                Earth and put them to sleep permanently in Dream Coffins that feed off the energy
                of the children's dreams. Using fairies to help her lure children to her castle,
                she hopes to capture enough energy to absorb the Earth. Chibiusa meets one of
                these fairies, Perle, whom she befriends rather quickly.</p>
            <p>Enchanted by his new friend, Perle decides to team up with Chibiusa to fight Queen
                Badiane. One of her other fairies is able to lure Chibiusa to the castle, but she
                is awakened once there by the four inner Super Sailor Senshi. The Super Sailor
                Senshi must try to free her before Badiane can collect enough sugar/dream energy
                to escape.</p>

            <summary>Trivia</summary>
            <ol>
                <li>This movie featured the only appearance of Sailor Pluto in Sailor Moon
                    SuperS, and the second (and last) appearances of Sailor Uranus and Sailor
                    Neptune (the first was in the Sailor Moon SuperS Special). They, along with
                    Sailor Pluto, would not be seen again until Sailor Moon Sailor Stars.</li>
                <li>This film seems to exist outside of the continuity of the rest of the anime.
                    While it seems to be set after the Sailor Moon SuperS season, the fact that
                    Sailor Pluto is fighting alongside Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune
                    contradicts her arrival in the first episode of Sailor Moon Sailor Stars.
                    When she appeared at that time, Uranus and Neptune were surprised that Pluto
                    is alive, because they had witnessed her "death" in a helicopter explosion in Sailor Moon S.</li>
                <li>The movie features the only on-screen appearance of Ami's mother in the anime continuity.</li>
                <li>In the English dub of this movie Mars Flame Sniper retained its name instead
                    of being called "Mars Flame Shooter" as it normally was in the dubbed TV series.</li>
                <li>The Pioneer release of this movie credited Chika Sakamoto as "Chinatsu Sakamoto."</li>
                <li>Super Moon Crisis Power was used for Sailor Moon and Sailor Mini-Moon's
                    transformation call instead of Moon Cosmic Dream Action like the dubbed TV series.</li>
