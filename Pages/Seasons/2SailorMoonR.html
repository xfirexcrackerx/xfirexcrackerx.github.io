<h3>Sailor Moon R (Season 2)</h3>
<article>
    <p>Sailor Moon R is the shortened title of Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon R (美少女戦士セーラームーン R,
        Bishōjo Senshi Sērā Mūn Āru). It is the second major story arc and series in the Sailor
        Moon anime. The letter R in its title, according to the Memorial Song Box booklet, can be
        expanded into either "Return" or "Romance". In the Sailor Moon manga, which came first,
        this story arc does not have a specific name, but its individual acts are inconsistently
        given the subtitle "Black Moon". The season is then followed by Sailor Moon S.<br>
        There is also a separate film called <a href="7Movies.html">Sailor Moon R: The Movie - The Promise
            of the Rose.</a>

    <h4>Opening Sequence</h4>
    <p>The opening sequence featured Moonlight Densetsu (ムーンライト伝説;
    "Moonlight Legend"), written by Kanako Oda and performed by DALI. There were 2 versions
    of the opening theme, the first having more generic visuals, the second more closely
    following and representing the story of the R season, as it features brand new places such as
    Crystal Tokyo, and even new characters: Neo-Queen Serenity, King Endymion, Chibiusa, Sailor
    Pluto, and the Black Moon family, which is called the Negamoon in the English version.</p>

    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <h5>Makaiju Arc</h5>
    <img
            src="http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/sailormoon/images/d/da/Makaiju.png/revision/latest?cb=20130711234211" class="makaiju" alt="the Makaiju Tree">
    <p>Sailor Moon R is set two months after the fall of the Dark Kingdom. The Sailor Scouts and
        Mamoru are living their normal lives with no memories of the events from the previous
    season. The first story, which lasted for the first 13 episodes of the season, features the
    regaining of the Inner Sailor Senshi's memories because of their encounters with new enemies, the
        Makaiju aliens (Ail and An), and is referred to as the Makaiju arc. Mamoru, however, didn't
        regain his memories immediately.</p>
    <p>
        Ail and An aimed to gather human energy to fuel their dying Makaiju Tree, their only source
        of life, to sustain themselves, and used monsters (called Cardian Monsters) to help steal energy.
        During their battles against their new enemies, each Scout unlocks a stronger version of
        their existing powers. In addition, a new character, the Moonlight Knight, appeared to help
        the Sailor Scouts in their time of need during battle, taking on the same role of Tuxedo Mask
        from the previous season.</p>

         alt="Ali and An">
    <p class="float">
        Ail and An disguised themselves as siblings attending Usagi's school while on earth. Their
        life on earth begun to teach them the meaning of love, something their race of aliens never
        understood. As their human alter egos, Ail even developed feelings towards Usagi while An
        developed hers towards Mamoru, resulting in a complicated love triangle.</p>
    <p>
        The Sailor Guardians eventually squares off against Ail and An in a final battle in episode
        thirteen. Witnessing the battle, they finally understood love and sacrifice for loved ones.
        When the Makaiju Tree turned in them, Ail put his life on the line to protect her, similar
        to what he saw Sailor Moon do with Mamoru. It was then, the Makaiju Tree stopped wrecking
        havoc because Ail and An finally learned love over greed. Ail, An, and the Makaiju Tree leaves
        earth for a peaceful new life elsewhere in the universe.</p>
    <p class="last">
        It was also revealed the Moonlight Knight was a split personality of Mamoru. After Queen
        Beryl's defeat, Mamoru lost his memories, but his desire to protect Sailor Moon wasn't, and
        so resulted in a split personality that reunited with Mamoru, after Mamoru began to regain
        his memories.</p>
