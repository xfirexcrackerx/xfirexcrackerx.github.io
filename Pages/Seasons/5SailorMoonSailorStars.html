<h3>Sailor Moon Sailor Stars (Season 5)</h3>
<article>
    <p>Sailor Moon: Sailor Stars (美少女戦士セーラームーン セーラースターズBishōjo Senshi Sērā Mūn Sērā Sutāzu)
    , (commonly reffered to as just Sailor Stars) is the fifth and final season in the original
    Sailor Moon metastases and covers the final thirty-four episodes of the original anime
        series.<br><br></p>
    <p>The season's first six episodes (Episodes 167-172) continues where the story left off in
    the fourth season, regarding the fate of Queen Nehellenia, and it then revolves around Sailor
    Galaxia and her quest to take Star Seeds from humans and other Sailor Soldiers in order to rule
    the galaxy as the strongest and most powerful Sailor Senshi in the entire Milky Way
        galaxy.<br><br></p>
    <p>The series made a number of changes from the previous ones, including the five Inner Senshi
    finally advancing to high school and introducing the Sailor Senshi from outside the Solar System.
    The Outer Solar System Senshi returned following their inadvertent absence from the fourth season.
    The show also had a new introduction with the Sailor Star Song, changing from the Moonlight
        Densetsu song that had been used for the previous four seasons.<br><br></p>
    <p>All four Outer Sailor Soldiers appear as recurring characters in their evolved Super
    Sailor forms (given to them by Sailor Saturn herself), but are never actually seen transforming
        on screen, despite being seen alone on several occasions.<br><br></p>
    <p>This series was not dubbed during the original run of the English dub because around the
    mid-2000s, the license for this season was cut off by Toei Animation from being distributed
    anywhere outside Japan; a common misconception was that it was because of the genderbending
    nature of the Sailor Stars, which wouldn't get past American censors due to possibly promoting
    transgender and homosexual themes. The season will finally be dubbed by Viz Media, and this
        new dub will see a release possibly around 2017.<br></p>
